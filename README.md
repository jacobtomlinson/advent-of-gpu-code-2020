This repo contains solutions to the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) written for the [GPU using Python](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/cuda/overview.html).

Solutions will be written live on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/constrainedcoding) and then recordings will be published to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwcSpcyRYsfZMsliAJzYuQ) later.

## FAQ

### What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a series of computer science problems released each day throughout December.

Participants have to write code to solve each problem.

### Who are you?

My name is [Jacob Tomlinson](https://twitter.com/_jacobtomlinson). I work for NVIDIA maintaining open source Python projects including [Dask](https://dask.org/) and [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/).

### You don't really seem to know what you are doing?

All of my work involves building distributed systems in Python. I focus heavily on deploying and building clusters of
machines to carry out data science workloads and then giving users visibility into what those clusters are doing. 

However I am originally from a sysadmin background and am not a data scientist. Therefore doing the Advent of Code in Python on the GPU is a way for me to level up my GPU coding skills.
